Basic Beer Chili
================

This is my brother's beer chili recipe from a while back. It won't win any
awards, but like all chili recipes it should be considered as a starting
point for making your own recipe. I suggest "kicking it up a notch".

I like to make this in a Creuset put, but any chili pot will do.

The choice of beer will determine the character of the chili. I like to use
a real skunky euro-style pils, like a Golden Pheasant. Other people will
prefer something like a Newcastle Brown Ale.

Like all chilis, tastes better the next day.

Serve with your prefered accoutrements.


I usually omit the bell pepper and instead use two jalapenos, a serrano,
a pablano, and an anaheim. I also add cayenne pepper.

This can also be done meatless, or with different meats. A meat loaf blend
(beef & pork) is good, or using steak cubes instead of ground.



Basic Beer Chili

1-1.5 lbs ground beef
1 white onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, diced
Some amount of garlic, diced
28oz can diced tomatoes
15oz can beans, drained (pinto or black)
12oz beer
Chili powder (tablespoons)
Cumin (teaspoons)



Salt and brown the ground beef on medium heat. I like to use a separate non-
stick frying pan to make draining it easier, and to let it brown while I sweat
the veggies.

Salt and sweat the onions and peppers.

When the beef is browned and the veggies are sweated, add the beef to the veggies.

Add the garlic and spices and stir.

Add the tomatoes and beans.

Add the beer.

Bring to a boil and then simmer for at least an hour, adding liquid if needed.

Simmer for at least one hour; two is a good amount.
